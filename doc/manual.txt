1. Overview

Modelica Development Tooling (MDT) Plug-In extends Eclipse to provide an environment
for working with Modelica projects. These features are provided:
o Modelica Projects management
o Modelica Sourcecode Editing support

Planned features:
o Debugging support
o Refactoring support

1.1 Background

MDT is created by <a href="">PELAB</a> at Linköping University as part of a <a href="">Open Modelica</a> effort.
Open Modelica aims at creating a complete development environment for Modelica development.

1.2 Requirements

To be able to use this package of fine software you will need a number of other packages of fine software.
These are:
* <a href="">Open Modelica</a>
* <a href="">Cygwin</a>
* <a href="">C/C++ Development Tooling</a>
Happy compiling! (and Hacking to get the %¤#%#¤! MICO to compile)

2. Getting started

The most convenient way to work with Modelica projects is to switch to the Modelica perspective.
To switch to the Modelica perspective, choose the Window menu item, pick Open Perspective followed by Other...
Select Modelica option from the dialog presented and click "OK". Not "Cancel". Or any other button.

2.1 Making a project

To start a new project, use the New Modelica Project Wizard. It is accesible through
File->New->Modelica Project.
After creating a project you can add files and folders to the project by selecting
the corresponding wizard found in File->New menu subsection.
Files having an extension of .mo will be treated as Modelica source code files by MDT.

2.2 Importing a project

To import an existing modelica project you need to create an empty modelica project. Use the import 
file system wizard to copy the files to the project's folder. The import wizard is available by right
clicking on the project in the Modelica Projects view. 



3. Building modelica projects

Building modelica projects is not supported out of the box right now. However it is possible to 
configure a regular eclipse builder for that purpose.
