BUGID: 4
STATUS: closed
TESTCASE: n/a
ENVIRONMENT: windows XP, omc 1.3.1
Expand 'System Library'->'Modelica'->SIunits'. A bunch of InvocationError
exceoptions are thrown. E.g.:

org.modelica.mdt.internal.omcproxy.InvocationError: getPackages(Modelica.SIunit\
s.ModulusOfAdmittance) replys 'error'
	at org.modelica.mdt.internal.omcproxy.OMCProxy.getPackages(OMCProxy.java:325)

This can be some sort of omc bug, getErrorString() returns:
#Error, lookup_classdef failed
Length in Modelica
[..snip..]
This should probably be reported upstream.

Try this. Select an open project and click on 'close project' menu (for example
in contex menu). Look at the menu again, 'Open project' is still disabled
