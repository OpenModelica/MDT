 followed by <b>Other...</b>

To start a new project, use the <b>New Modelica Project</b> Wizard. It is accesible through
<b>File > New > Modelica Project</b>.
After creating a project you can add files and folders to the project by selecting
the corresponding wizard found in <b>File > New</b> menu subsection.
Files having an extension <i>.mo</i> will be treated as Modelica source code files by MDT.

<p>
To import an existing modelica project you need to create an empty modelica project and populate it
with existing files. Create a new modelica project with the wizard. Use the file system import wizard 
on that project to copy the files to the project's folder. The import wizard is available by right
clicking on the project in the <b>Modelica Projects</b> view and choosing <b>Import...</b> alternative.
