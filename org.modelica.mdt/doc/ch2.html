MDT need to be able to locate the binary of the compiler. It uses the
environment variable OPENMODELICAHOME to do so.<br>
If you have problems using MDT make sure that OPENMODELICAHOME is set to the 
folder where the Open Modelica Compiler is installed. In other words 
OPENMODELICAHOME must point to the folder that contais Open Modelica compiler
binary. It is named omc.exe on Windows Platform and omc on Unix platforms.

<h2 id = "using_modelica_perspective">Using Modelica Perspective</h2>

Modelica perspective. To switch to the Modelica perspective, choose the 
<b>Window</b> menu item, pick <b>Open Perspective</b>
 followed by <b>Other...</b>
Select <b>Modelica</b> option from the dialog presented and click <b>OK</b>.
Not <b>Cancel</b>. Or any other button.

<h2 id = "making_a_project">Making a project</h2>
<p>
To start a new project, use the <b>New Modelica Project</b> Wizard. It is accesible through
<b>File > New > Modelica Project</b>.
After creating a project you can add files and folders to the project by selecting
the corresponding wizard found in <b>File > New</b> menu subsection.
Files having an extension <i>.mo</i> will be treated as Modelica source code files by MDT.

<h2 id = "importing_a_project">Importing a project</h2>
<p>
To import an existing modelica project you need to create an empty modelica project and populate it
with existing files. Create a new modelica project with the wizard. Use the file system import wizard 
on that project to copy the files to the project's folder. The import wizard is available by right
clicking on the project in the <b>Modelica Projects</b> view and choosing <b>Import...</b> alternative.
