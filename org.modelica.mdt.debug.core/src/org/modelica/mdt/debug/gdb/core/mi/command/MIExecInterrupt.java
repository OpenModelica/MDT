 *  Asynchronous command.  Interrupts the background execution of the
 *  target.  Note how the token associated with the stop message is the one
 *  for the execution command that has been interrupted.  The token for the
 *  interrupt itself only appears in the `^done' output.  If the user is
 *  trying to interrupt a non-running program, an error message will be
 *  printed.
