Some information about working on MDT regression tests set.

Project Name
------------
Many test cases need to create a projects to setup the environment for testing.
Becouse all the tests are run in the same workspace there is a risk of 
conflicts in the projects namespace between different test cases. To avoid this
and to simplify maintainance of the tests, following scheme should be used apon
creation of guinnia pig projects.

For each created project a constant PROJECT_NAME_n must be created. The constant
should be assigned value of TestCaseName.class.getName() + "1". For example test
case TestFoo, which will create two project will contain following constant
declaration:

public class TestFoo extends TestCase 
{
	private static final String PROJECT_NAME_1 = 
		TestFoo.class.getName() + "1";

	private static final String PROJECT_NAME_2 = 
		TestFoo.class.getName() + "2";
    
    // .....
}
