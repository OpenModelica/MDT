Stuff that are nice to know if you want to hack on MDT.

I. Making a release

I.I. Motivational blurb

The intention of this section is to serve as both a cheat sheet while making a 
release and to formalize the release building process. A more formal release
procedure should help avoid making stupid misstakes and hopefully improve the
quality of the releases. All in all, doesn't everyone love processes?

I.II. The release procedure

 * start with a clean workspace, e.g. use File->Switch Workspace and switch to
   an empty folder
   
 * checkout (as Plugin-Projects) from whatever branch/revision you want to make
   a release:
   
    - org.modelica.mdt
    - org.modelica.mdt.tests
    
 * run the regression tests
   If some of the tests fail, go back to the drawing board.
   
 * Start over with a clean workspace
 
 * Make a version tag in the repository
 
 * Checkout from version tag location in the repository:

    - org.modelica.mdt
    - org.modelica.mdt.tests
    - org.modelica.mdt.feature
    - org.modelica.mdt.site
  
 * Update version number in org.modelica.mdt/plugin.xml
 
 * Run 'PDE site'->'Build site' from the context menu of 
   org.modelica.mdt.site/site.xml

 * Export the update site to a public webserver, use 'Export'->'File System'
   wizard. Make sure that both features and plugin directories are exported.     
   
 * Test with a clean eclipse installation that the MDT-plugin installs correctly
   from the update site. Use the Help->'Software Updates'->'Find and Install...'
   Check that it runs as expected.
   
 * Enjoy the release party!
