<p>
Building Modelica projects is not supported out of the box right now. However it is possible to 
instruct Eclipse to use an external program for building. This is done by creating a so called
project builder.
</p>

<h2 id = "creating_a_builder">Creating a builder</h2>

<p>
To create a builder, right click a project and select <b>Properties</b>. Select the <b>Builders</b> option
and then click <b>New...</b> Choose <b>Program</b> as configuration type. On the next screen, enter the path
to the make binary in <b>Location</b> field. To select the <b>Working Directory</b>, 
click <b>Browse Workspace...</b> and select your project from the list.

If you're building OpenModelica you'll also need to set up some environment variables.
Click on the <b>Environment</b> tab to view the current variables. To add a new variable, simply
click <b>New...</b> The variables that are needed for building OpenModelica are ANTLRHOME, CLASSPATH
and RMLHOME. Refer to the OpenModelica README file for details.

<p>
When you're finished, click <b>OK</b> and close the <b>Properties</b> dialog. Now you have to disable the automatic
build feature by deselecting <b>Build Automatically</b> in the <b>Project</b> menu item.
</p>

<p>
Now you can build the project by selecting <b>Build Project</b> from the project context menu which you reach
by right clicking on the project in the Modelica Projects view. Automatic incremental building of Modelica projects
is not supported at this time, but stay tuned.
