<h1>Getting started</h1>

<h2 id = "configurate_omc">Configuring the OpenModelica Compiler</h2>

MDT need to be able to locate the binary of the OpenModelica Compiler. It uses the
environment variable OPENMODELICAHOME to do so.<br>
If you have problems using MDT make sure that OPENMODELICAHOME is set to the 
folder where the Open Modelica Compiler is installed. In other words 
OPENMODELICAHOME must point to the folder that contais Open Modelica compiler
binary. It is named omc.exe on Windows Platform and omc on Unix platforms.

<h2 id = "using_modelica_perspective">Accessing the Modelica Perspective</h2>

<p>
The most convenient way to work with Modelica projects is to use to the
Modelica perspective. To switch to the Modelica perspective, choose the 
<b>Window</b> menu item, pick <b>Open Perspective</b>
 followed by <b>Other...</b>
Select the <b>Modelica</b> option from the dialog presented and click <b>OK</b>.
Not <b>Cancel</b>. Or any other button.
</p>

<h2 id = "making_a_project">Making a project</h2>
<p>
To start a new project, use the <b>New Modelica Project</b> Wizard. It is
accessible through <b>File > New > Modelica Project</b>.
After creating a project you can add files and folders to the project by selecting
the corresponding wizard found in <b>File > New</b> menu subsection.
Files having an extension <i>.mo</i> will be treated as Modelica source code files by MDT.

<h2 id = "importing_a_project">Importing a project</h2>
<p>
To import an existing modelica project you need to create an empty modelica project and populate it
with existing files. Create a new modelica project with the wizard. Use the file system import wizard 
on that project to copy the files to the project's folder. The import wizard is available by right
clicking on the project in the <b>Modelica Projects</b> view and choosing <b>Import...</b> alternative.
</p>

<h2 = "making_a_package">Making a package</h2>
<p>
To create a new Modelica package, use the <b>New Modelica Package</b> Wizard.
You can access it by going through <b>File > New > Modelica Package</b> or by
right-clicking in a project and selecting <b>New > Modelica Package</b>.
Enter the desired name of the package and a description about what it contains.
</p>

<h2 = "making_a_class">Making a class</h2>
<p>
To make a new Modelica class, select where in the hierarchy that you want to add
your new class and select <b>File > New > Modelica Class</b>. When creating a
Modelica class you can add different restrictions on what the class can contain.
These can for example be <i>model</i>, <i>connector</i>, <i>block</i>,
<i>record</i>, or <i>function</i>.
When you have selected your desired class type, you can select modifiers that
add code blocks to the generated code. <i>Include initial code block</i> will for
example add the line <b>initial equation</b> to the class.
</p>

<h2 = "syntax_checking">Syntax checking</h2>
<p>
Whenever a Modelica (.mo) file is saved in the Modelica Editor, it is checked
for syntactical errors. Any errors that are found are added to the Problems view
and also marked in the source code editor. Errors are marked in the editor as a
red circle with a white cross, a squiggly red line under the problematic
construct, and as a red marker in the right-hand side of the editor. If you want
to reach the problem, you can either click the item in the Problems view or
select the red box in the right-hand side of the editor.
</p>

<h2 = "code_completion">Code completion</h2>
<p>
If you type a dot (.) after anything that is loaded into OMC, code completion
will kick in. If you for example type <b>Modelica.</b>, a list with packages
and classes that are available in the Modelica package will be displayed. You
can narrow down the matches by typing in the first characters of the class or
package that you want to type in. So if you've first typed <b>Modelica.</b> you
can the continue typing <b>Me</b> and MDT will propose <b>Mechanics</b> and
<b>Media</b> as completions. You can always backtrack the narrowing by erasing
characters.<br>
<b>Note:</b> As of now, you have to have the Modelica System Library loaded for
code completion on the system library to work. This can right now be
accomplished by browsing the Modelica System Library in the projects view before
trying to use code completion.
