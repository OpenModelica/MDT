<h1>Modelica Development Tooling Help</h1>
<p>
The Modelica Development Tooling (MDT) Plug-In integrates the OpenModelica
compiler with Eclipse. MDT, together with the OpenModelica compiler provides an
environment for working with Modelica projects.

<h2 id = "features">Features</h2>
MDT is still in the early development stages but it does provide a simple
environment for a Modelica programmer. The following features are implemented so
far:

<ul>
<li>browsing support for Modelica classes</li>
<li>syntax color highlighting</li>
<li>syntax checking</li>
<li>syntax error highlighting</li>
<li>simple code completion</li>
<li>wizards for creation of projects, packages, and classes</li>
<li>Modelica System Library browsing support</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "nonfeatures">Missing features</h2>
Some features are as of now missing from MDT:

<ul>
<li>simulation of models</li>
<li>loading of classes into correct namespace</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "issues">Known issues</h2>
The following are some know issues with MDT:

<ul>
<li>OMC defines tabs as 8 characters while in Eclipse tabs are only 1 character.
    This will lead to problems when displaying error markers in Modelica models.
    To avoid problems with displaying error markers, use only space to format
    the model definitions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "background">Background</h2>
<p>
MDT is created by <a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~pelab/">PELAB</a> at 
<a href="http://www.liu.se">Link&ouml;ping University</a> as part of an 
<a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~pelab/modelica/OpenModelica.html">OpenModelica</a>
effort. OpenModelica aims at creating a complete development environment for 
Modelica development.
</p>
<h2 id = "requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>
MDT requires at least the OpenModelica compiler
<a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/labs/pelab/modelica/OpenModelica.html#Download">
version 1.3</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> 3.1. Other
versions of Open Modelica and Eclipse may work, but have not been tested.

Happy compiling!
