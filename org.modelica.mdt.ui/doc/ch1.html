<h1>Modelica Development Tooling Help</h1>
<p>
The Modelica Development Tooling (MDT) Plug-In integrates the OpenModelica
compiler with Eclipse. MDT, together with the OpenModelica compiler provides an
environment for working with Modelica projects.

<h2 id = "features">Features</h2>
MDT is still in the early development stages but it does provide a simple
environment for a Modelica programmer. The following features are implemented so
far:

<ul>
<li>browsing support for Modelica classes</li>
<li>syntax color highlighting</li>
<li>syntax checking</li>
<li>syntax error highlighting</li>
<li>simple code completion</li>
<li>wizards for creation of projects, packages, and classes</li>
<li>Modelica System Library browsing support</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "nonfeatures">Missing features</h2>
Some features are as of now missing from MDT:

<ul>
<li>simulation of models from within MDT</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "issues">Known issues</h2>
The following are some know issues with MDT:

<ul>
<li>Due to compatibilies problems between eclipse framework and OMC parser
tab characters in the source code are not supported. When tabs are present
in the sourcecode some MDT features, such as error markers and code completion
will not work properly. Avoid using tabs when possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "background">Background</h2>
<p>
MDT is created by <a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~pelab/">PELAB</a> at 
<a href="http://www.liu.se">Link&ouml;ping University</a> as part of an 
<a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~pelab/modelica/OpenModelica.html">OpenModelica</a>
effort. OpenModelica aims at creating a complete development environment for 
Modelica development.
</p>
<h2 id = "requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>
MDT requires at least the OpenModelica compiler
<a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/labs/pelab/modelica/OpenModelica.html#Download">
version 1.3.2</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> 3.1. Other
versions of Eclipse may work, but have not been tested.

Happy compiling!
