THE MDT-GRAPHICAL DEPENDENCY BROWSER MANUAL

* ABOUT

This feature has been developed by Magnus Sjöstrand as a master thesis subject, based on previous work by Adeel Asghar and Leonardo Laguna Ruiz. All relevant files can be found in the svn repository under org.modelica.mdt.ui.graph .

* THESIS REPORT

The thesis report will contain some information on how the implementation of this extension looks like so that others may improve on the current version.

* REQUIREMENTS

The most important thing to add in order to build this is the graphical Zest-library. It is based on SWT and Draw2D. This is currently included in the SVN checkout.
In case you miss it you can find it by using the Eclipse update manager to install it under a correct updating site. The suggested updating site provided by the official homepage of Zest (GEF) is https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/gef-master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/update-site/

If you don't find it there then you may have to unflag Group items by category to see Eclipse Zest.
It should contain the following dependencies:

  + Graphical Editing Framework Draw2d
  + Graphical Editing Framework Draw2d SDK
  + Graphical Editing Framework Draw2D Source Feature
  + Graphical Editing Framework Zest Visualization Toolkit

The current version has not been tested under OS X and isn't recommended until there is a stable OS X-version of MDT.

* EXTRA

The thesis report and upcoming user guide will also feature another view called Optimization browser, which is also a extension of MDT. This includes a view with both visual and textual tracing of the current state of a model, and what the outcome of each transformation is on a mathematical expression.


* FURTHER INFORMATION

A user guide will be added in the furture.
