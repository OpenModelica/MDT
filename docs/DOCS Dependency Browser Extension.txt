THE MDT-GRAPHICAL DEPENDENCY BROWSER MANUAL

* THESIS REPORT

The thesis report will contain some information on how the implementation of this extension looks like so that
others may improve on the current version.

* REQUIREMENTS

The most important thing to add in order to build this is the graphical Zest-library. It is based on SWT and Draw2D.
You can find it by using the Eclipse update manager to install it under a correct updating site.
The suggested updating site provided by the official homepage of Zest (GEF) is
https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/gef-master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/update-site/

In case you don't find it there then you may have to unflag Group items by category to see Eclipse Zest.
It should contain the following dependencies:

  + Graphical Editing Framework Draw2d
  + Graphical Editing Framework Draw2d SDK
  + Graphical Editing Framework Draw2D Source Feature
  + Graphical Editing Framework Zest Visualization Toolkit

The current version has not been tested under Mac and isn't recommended until there is a stable Mac-version of MDT.

* FURTHER INFORMATION

A user guide will be added in the furture.
