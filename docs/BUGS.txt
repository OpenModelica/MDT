If the exists tab characters (\t) in the modelica source code then the region
reported by IModelicaElement.getLocation() will be wrong. This is due to the
fact that OMC counts each tab as 8 characters and eclipse text framework as
1 character.

There is no straighforward way to fix this bug. Best way it to discuss this
with OMC hackers and agreen on some sort of standard or something.

One way to fix this is to change OMC to count each tab as 1 character and
instead of returning start/end line and start/end column for each element
is to report only start and end character. However this probably will break 
other OMC clients. No, life aint easy.

ENVIRONMENT: windows XP, omc 1.3.1
Expand 'System Library'->'Modelica'->SIunits'. A bunch of InvocationError
exceoptions are thrown. E.g.:

org.modelica.mdt.internal.omcproxy.InvocationError: getPackages(Modelica.SIunit\
s.ModulusOfAdmittance) replys 'error'
	at org.modelica.mdt.internal.omcproxy.OMCProxy.getPackages(OMCProxy.java:325)

This can be some sort of omc bug, getErrorString() returns:
#Error, lookup_classdef failed
Length in Modelica
[..snip..]
This should probably be reported upstream.

'Open project' and 'Close project' menu items are not updated after invocation.

Try this. Select an open project and click on 'close project' menu (for example
in contex menu). Look at the menu again, 'Open project' is still disabled 
and 'Close project' enabled. Same problem if you open a closed project.
