# Modelica Development Tooling - MDT

The Modelica Development Tooling (MDT) Eclipse plugin integrates the OpenModelica compiler with Eclipse and provides an environment for working with Modelica and MetaModelica development projects. This plugin is primarily intended for tool developers rather than application Modelica modelers.
